Giving Tree is a web application that connects nonprofit organizations with potential donors through community foundations. Foundations learn about the specific needs of nonprofits in their area and post these "giving opportunities" on Giving Tree, where they are visible to a much wider donor base.  Donors can search for, view, and then contribute to giving opportunities that interest them.
